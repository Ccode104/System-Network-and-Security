# README - Number Theory Algorithms

## Overview
This repository contains implementations of various number theory algorithms using C and the GMP library. Each program takes input through command-line arguments and produces relevant outputs. The programs cover fundamental concepts such as GCD computation, modular arithmetic, prime factorization, congruence solutions, and more.

## Prerequisites
- Install the GMP (GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic) Library.
- Compile using `gcc` with the GMP library linked:
  ```sh
  gcc -o program program.c -lgmp
  ```
- Run the programs using:
  ```sh
  ./program [arguments]
  ```

## Programs and Test Cases

### 1. Common Divisors
**Usage:**
```sh
./common_divisors n m1 m2 ... mn

```sh
./extended_euclid 30 20
```
**Output:**
```
x = 1, y = -1, gcd = 10
```

### 3. Prime Factorization (Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic)
**Usage:**
```sh
./prime_factors n
```
**Example:**
```sh
./prime_factors 60
```
**Output:**
```
2 2 3 5
```

### 4. Reduced Residue System Modulo m
**Usage:**
```sh
./rrsm m
```
**Example:**
```sh
./rrsm 10
```
**Output:**
```
1 3 7 9
φ(10) = 4
```

### 5. Fast Exponentiation using Fermat’s Theorem
**Usage:**
```sh
./fast_exponentiation a x n
```
**Example:**
```sh
./fast_exponentiation 3 4 5
```
**Output:**
```
3^4 mod 5 = 1
```

### 6. Multiplicative Inverse
**Usage:**
```sh
./multiplicative_inverse a m
```
**Example:**
```sh
./multiplicative_inverse 3 7
```
**Output:**
```
Inverse: 5 mod 7
```

### 7. Solutions of Congruence
**Usage:**
```sh
./congruence_solution a b m
```
**Example:**
```sh
./congruence_solution 4 6 10
```
**Output:**
```
Number of solutions: 2
x = 4
x = 9
```

### 8. System of Congruences using Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT)
**Usage:**
```sh
./crt a1 m1 a2 m2  ...
```
x = a1 mod m1
x = a2 mod m2 ...

**Example:**
```sh
./crt 2 3 3 5 2 7
```
**Output:**
```
Solution exists
x ≡ 23 mod 105
```

### 9. Order of a Modulo m
**Usage:**
```sh
./order a m
```
**Example:**
```sh
./order 3 7
```
**Output:**
```
The order is 6
```

### 10. Primitive Roots
**Usage:**
```sh
./primitive_roots m
```
**Example:**
```sh
./primitive_roots 10
```
**Output:**
```
Total primitive roots: 2
PR: 3
PR: 7
```

## Notes
- Ensure GMP is installed for high-precision arithmetic.
- Modify the programs if needed to accommodate different input formats.
- The outputs are illustrative and may vary based on inputs.
- If you get any wrong outputs(errors), kindly inform me
(I had given the original codes to Chatgpt for formatting purposes to make them more readable and understandable.
If any errors were introduced during this process, 
I would be happy to rectify them or share the original code.)
- The test cases used are also generated by Chatgpt. I edited the wrong ones and have also tested my codes against them.
